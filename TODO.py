# TODO - Use Cases TO DO:
#  - Specific Model calls to
#     - Remove a Node
#     - Remove an Interface/Circuit
#     - Remove a demand
#     - Change demand magnitude
#     *** These can all be done now, but require a few API calls to do so

# TODO - example script with SRLGs

# TODO -  Node tags
#     - add node tags for organizing/grouping/filtering-to nodes
#     - for network graph plot, have option to only show nodes with
#       certain user specified tags

# TODO - Use Cases TO DO:
#  - Save an existing model to a file

#     - Remove an Interface/Circuit
#     - Remove a demand
#     - Change demand magnitude
#     *** These can all be done now, but require a few API calls to do s

# TODO - User experience TO DO:
#  - save_model call that will save model data to file
#  - new client code example that uses a save_model call

# TODO - test model with demands over LSPs and routed demands in same Model - check to see if did this
