Changelog
=========

2.1
---
*  Enforcing tab-separated data in model data files (used to allow spaces or tabs between data entries)
*  FlexModel class allows IGP RSVP shortcuts
*  FlexModel and PerformanceModel classes allow/honor RSVP LSP manual metrics
*  Made load_model_file for FlexModel and PerformanceModel classes more forgiving for number of lines allowed between tables

2.0
---
*  Made version 1.7 into major version 2.0 to account for possible backwards compatibilty

1.7
---
* Renamed Model class to PerformanceModel
* Renamed Parallel_Link_Model class to FlexModel
* Optimization: general 18-25% performance improvement when measured by time to converge
* Moved common code from PerformanceModel and FlexModel to _MasterModel parent class
* Maintained unit testing coverage at 95%
* Cleaned up documentation/docstrings

1.6
---
* Added support for multiple links between nodes (Parallel_Link_Model)
* Cached parallel_lsp_groups in Model and Parallel_Link_Model objects (performance optimization)
* Added check for multiple links between nodes in Model object (not allowed)
* Added Parent Class _MasterModel to hold common defs for Model and Parallel_Link_Model subclasses
* Added simulation_diagnostics def in _MasterModel that gives potentially useful diagnostic info about the simulation results
* Simple user interface (beta feature) supports RSVP LSPs

1.5
---

previous releases
------------------
* versions prior to v1.0 were not released to pip, but distributed as a github directory
* initially a py2 version was made available `here <https://github.com/tim-fiola/network_traffic_modeler>`_
* the py2 version is not maintained anymore in favor of the current py3 releases
