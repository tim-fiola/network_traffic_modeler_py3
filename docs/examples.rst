Interactive Map
----------------

The examples folder includes an interactive network visualization allowing user to

* view the network
* move nodes
* get tooltips via hovering over links
* filter to visualizing only links in certain utilization ranges

The UI (simple_user_interface.py) is specifically designed to address common modeling use cases

* provide quick linkage between related objects: Nodes, interfaces, and demands (traffic)
* allow the user to explore the shortest paths and all feasible (loop free) paths between selected nodes
* examine traffic on interfaces above a specified utilization percentage
