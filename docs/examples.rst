Examples
=========

Demo/Example scripts
--------------------

These scripts are in the ``examples`` directory and are meant to showcase different capabilities and how to use them.

The ``lsp_practice_code.py`` script demos how auto-bandwidth RSVP LSPs react to

* link failures
* adding traffic
* adding additional LSPs

The ``network_modeling_client_code_examples_read_from_dict.py`` file demo2 the following:

* loading a network topology from a list of info (instead of a model file)
* addition of new circuit and node to the network
* viewing interface traffic
* getting the shortest path
* failing an interface
* demand path changes before/after a link failure
* adding traffic

Demo Script With Visualization
------------------------------

There is also a visualization script, which showcases a current beta feature.
See the `visualization <visualization.rst>`_ docs page for more details.
